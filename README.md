## Project Description

Gardening can be a tough hobby to get in to. With an almost countless amount of things that can go wrong, some people seem to think that they lack a "green thumb". The Demeter system aims to reduce the knowledge barrier of entry for gardening by recommending the optimal plants for your garden based on sunlight exposure, local forecasts, and user preferences.

## How It Works

Demeter is a two part software-hardware system. First our daylight exposure sensors use photoresistors (alongside some clever math) to approximate the number lux (unit of measure for light) in an indoor or outdoor space. This data is then fed to our AI-powered webapp, that along with local forecast information and the users preferences of plant types and watering schedules, recommends the best plant for that area and user.
